# AMR Metadata Review

This is the repository for the AMR Metadata review.  It includes all the models that were built for the paper as well as the data required to generate the models and steps and scripts on how to download the fasta files required to download the data from the PATRIC FTP servers.  All models are built using the [Genomic Model Creator](https://github.com/Tinyman392/GenomicModelCreator) repository which will be linked in this repo.  Although command line code will be provided on how to build our models, there is additional information about the model building process in the GenomicModelCreator repo.
